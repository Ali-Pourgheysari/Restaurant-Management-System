# Restaurant-Management-System

This is a very simple restaurant management system (my first project ever)

## Start page

* First you need to sign up as a Admin or as a User. 

<img src="./screenshot/01 start page.png">

* As you can see we see a screen like this that we can choose whether 1 or 2. if we choose 1 then we are asked if we want to enter as an admin or not. we choose "u" to enter as a user. Here we enter as a Manager at first.

* Now if we sign up with Admin again we face an error that we already have one.

* This is how we can sign up as a user.

* If we sign up with user we are asked to enter the username and if it is not valid we are asked to sign up first.

* If we already have a user with the exact username we are asked to sign up with anothe username.

* In logging in if the username doesn't match with the password we are asked to enter password again.

## Admin Account

* Now as an admin we can whether order food or edit the menu.

* By pressing 2 we are shown a list that we must choose how me can edit the menu. Now we want to edit an existing item in the menu. we can edit the name of it whether the price of it. Here we edit the name.

* We can order food with Admin account as well but we explain it later with the User account.

## User Account

* As a user we can only order food. First we need to choose an item then we need to enter the quantity of the item. Then we can see details and the total price of the order.
